# FoxGlow

This mod makes foxes glow when they eat Glow Berries. Simple right? This should be in vanilla, anyway you can have it this way now!

### Configuration
You can adjust the duration of the glow effect using the gamerule `foxGlowDuration`. It takes one parametere which is the duration in seconds. (Withou decimals)

`/gamerule foxGlowDuration <duration>`

For example, 2 seconds would be
`/gamerule foxGlowDuration 2`

Also, as side note there is also an Italian localization of the gamerule in the World Creation screen.
